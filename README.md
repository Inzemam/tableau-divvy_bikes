The full data set is fairly large (~3.5 GB).  Available from the City of Chicago Data Portal. (Click on Export at the top of the page and choose CSV.)  So if you're going to download from here, give yourself some time where you'll stay connected to network for a while.  

I have also compressed it and made it available via Dropbox, which should be much faster.  The link to that is here: Divvy Bike Trip Data on Dropbox

There is additional info available from City of Chicago Data Portal

Anyone interested in looking into the Community Area data associated with this data set, you can find that Geospatial Data here: Boundaries - Community Areas _current_.geojson 

And here's a link to some info on how to load and use it in Tableau:  https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_shapefiles.html
